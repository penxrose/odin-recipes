    <h1>Iced Matcha Latte</h1>
    <img src="../images/matchalatte-400x438.33.jpg">
    <h3>This iced matcha latte recipe is one that I created to be
    simple enough that <em>anyone</em> can follow along. It's quick, 
    adaptable, and requires no fancy equipment (my favorite
    kind of recipe)!</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <em>Matcha latte</em>
        <ul>
        <li>3 tsp matcha powder</li>
        <li>16oz milk or any dairy alternative</li>
        <li>2oz water</li>
        <li>Crushed or cubed ice</li>
        </ul>
    <em>Vanilla simple syrup</em>
        <ul>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Begin by putting a pot or kettle of water on the stove to boil.
        Don't worry too much about measuring your water exactly here, just be
        sure you have a bit more than a cup to start.</li>
        <li>Add 3 tsp of matcha to a small cup or bowl.</li>
        <li>In a separate container add 1 cup of granulated sugar (set aside 
        your measuring cup for later steps!) and 2 tbsp of vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Prepare your favorite cup by adding ice and 16oz of milk, I prefer 
        Oatly for my latte but this is absolutely interchangable with your 
        favoite milk of choice.</li>
        <li>Once your water has come to a boil, take it off the heat and add 1 cup 
        of water to your sugar and vanilla. Mix together until sugar completely 
        dissolves.</li>
        <li>Next, add about 2oz of water to your matcha powder and mix thoroughly to 
        ensure there are no lumps of powder.</li>
        <li>Add your matcha mixture to your milk as well as your vanilla syrup to taste,
        give your latte a good stir and enjoy!
        </li>
        </ol>
    <p><strong>Recipe notes:</strong></p>
    <p>This recipe was made to be <em>easy and adaptable</em>, please feel free to use more 
    or less matcha powder and water to make your mixture! Not all matchas are created equally
    so adjust to your preference of tea strength and consistency.</p>
    <p>The syrup in this recipe calls for a 1:1 ratio of sugar and water, it's easiest to 
    measure equal parts for this step in grams but for the sake of simplicity in this recipe 
    you want to use the same measuring cup for both your sugar and water. You can also use any 
    other flavor in place of vanilla if you please, have fun with this!
