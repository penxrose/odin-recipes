    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <em>Loaf cake</em>
        <ul>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp lemon zest (from 1 medium sized lemon)</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 cup greek yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil or neutral vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ cup blueberries, washed and dried</li>
        <li>1 tbsp all purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
    <em>Lemon glaze</em>
        <ul>
        <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tbsp heavy cream</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F and grease 9x5 loaf pan with baking spray or line with parchment 
            paper and set aside.</li>
        <li>Toss the blueberries with 1 tablespoon of flour and set aside.</li>
        <li>In small bowl combine the lemon zest and sugar. Mix together with your fingers until 
            zest is coated with sugar and sugar is infused.</li>
        <li>In large bowl add the sugar zest mixture and whisk in the eggs and the oil until well 
            combined.</li>
        <li>Then whisk in the yoghurt, lemon juice and the vanilla. </li>
        <li>Sift the flour, salt and baking powder right into the wet ingredients then whisk until 
            just combined. Do not overmix. It's ok if there are still a few streaks of flour in the 
            batter.</li>
        <li>Fold in the blueberries until combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the loaf pan and smooth the top of batter.</li>
        <li>Bake for approximately 50 minutes or until top is golden brown and tester comes out clean. 
            Allow loaf to cool in pan for about 10 minutes then remove the bread from the pan and allow 
            it to cool completely on rack.</li>
        <li>While bread is cooling make the glaze: In small bowl whisk together the powdered sugar, 
            lemon juice and the cream until smooth. Add more sugar or more juice to obtain desired 
            consistency.</li>
        <li>Drizzle glaze over the cooled loaf. Serve immediately or store bread in sealed container. 
            Loaf can be stored in a sealed container at room temperature for 3-4 days.</li>
        </ol>
